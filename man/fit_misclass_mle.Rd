\title{Joint MLE under the binary misclassification model.}
\usage{
fit_misclass_mle(y_cal, yhat_cal, yhat_test)
}
\arguments{
\item{y_cal}{Human labels on the calibration split (0/1).}

\item{yhat_cal}{Surrogate predictions on the calibration split (0/1).}

\item{yhat_test}{Surrogate predictions on the unlabeled/test split (0/1).}
}
\value{
A list containing the MLEs, variance-covariance matrices from the
observed and expected Fisher information, and Wald intervals for \\theta.
}
\description{
Estimates \\theta, q0, and q1 by maximizing the joint likelihood built from
labeled calibration data and unlabeled surrogate outputs, then obtains
standard errors via the inverse Fisher information (observed and expected).
