\title{Euclidean projection onto the probability simplex.}
\usage{
project_simplex(v)
}
\arguments{
\item{v}{Numeric vector.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector on the simplex (nonnegative, sums to 1).
}
\description{
Implements the standard sorting/threshold algorithm used for sparsemax and
simplex projection: finds the closest probability vector to an unconstrained
input under the L2 norm.
