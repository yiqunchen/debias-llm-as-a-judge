\title{EIF estimator with GAM calibration}
\usage{
eif_gam_discrete_point_and_ci(Y_cal, Yhat_cal, Yhat_test, alpha = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y_cal}{Vector of true labels on the calibration set.}

\item{Yhat_cal}{Vector of surrogate predictions on the calibration set.}

\item{Yhat_test}{Vector of surrogate predictions on the test set.}

\item{alpha}{Miscoverage level for the confidence interval.}
}
\description{
Fits g(Yhat) using a GAM with smooth term.
For discrete Yhat with few categories, this behaves similarly to per-category.
